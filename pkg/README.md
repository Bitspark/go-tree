# Go-Tree Package Architecture

The Go-Tree system is organized into a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns. This document provides an overview of the package structure and the relationships between components.

## Package Organization

The package structure is organized into five main categories:

### [`core`](./core)
Fundamental building blocks and data structures:
- `graph`: Generic graph data structures
- `typesys`: Type system foundation
- `index`: Fast indexing capabilities

### [`io`](./io)
Input/output operations for code and modules:
- `loader`: Load Go code from filesystem
- `saver`: Save code back to filesystem
- `resolve`: Resolve module dependencies
- `materialize`: Materialize modules for execution

### [`run`](./run)
Runtime and execution components:
- `execute`: Execute Go code with type awareness
- `testing`: Enhanced testing capabilities
- `toolkit`: General utilities and tools

### [`ext`](./ext)
Extension components for analysis and transformation:
- `analyze`: Code analysis capabilities
- `transform`: Type-safe code transformations
- `visual`: Visualization of code structures

### [`service`](./service)
Integration layer that provides a unified API to all components.

## Architectural Layers

The packages are organized in layers, with higher layers depending on lower ones:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│             service                 │
├─────────────────┬───────────────────┤
│       ext       │        run        │
├─────────────────┴───────────────────┤
│                 io                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│                core                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Dependency Rules

The architectural design enforces these dependency rules:

1. Lower layers must not depend on higher layers
2. Packages at the same layer may depend on each other with care
3. All packages may depend on `core` packages
4. The `service` package may depend on all other packages

## Design Principles

The architecture is guided by these principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each package has a well-defined responsibility
2. **Dependency Management**: Clear dependency rules prevent cycles
3. **Layered Architecture**: Components build on each other in clearly defined layers
4. **Type Safety**: All operations maintain type correctness through the type system
5. **Extension Points**: Higher layers provide extension points for customization

## Development Guidelines

When contributing to Go-Tree, keep these guidelines in mind:

1. Place new functionality in the appropriate architectural layer
2. Respect the dependency rules between packages
3. Build on lower layers rather than duplicating functionality
4. Extend using provided extension points when possible
5. Add tests that validate functionality across layers
